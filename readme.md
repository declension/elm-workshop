# Elm basics workshop

This repo contains Elm code for a simple ToDo app, created for an Elm workshop!
To start the workshop, checkout to the `ws-start` tag, and then create a new
branch:

```
git checkout ws-start

git checkout -b <name for your branch>
```

The workshop consists of 6 exercises:

1. Add missing function signatures
2. Define model and types required for the todo app
3. Add an html input element, which should be used to set new `todo` item text
4. Implement item `add` functionality, and render a list of todo items
5. Implement item `remove` functionality
6. **Bonus exercise**: add some styling


Each exercise step is tagged, you can use git to checkout to any one of them,
and review the code if necessary. To view the tags:

```
git tag -l
```

Tho, try to solve the exercise step before you decide it's time to take a peek
at a solution.
